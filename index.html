<!-- It works with the three css files in this folder: example1.css, example2.css and example3.css. -->
<!-- The HTML file defines the structure of the page, and the CSS files define how it looks. -->

    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair
